PowerDNS Autoreverse Generator v0.1 (c) Aki Tuomi 2012

1. Installation
2. Configuration
3. Testing

1. Installation

  Copy the script to the place of your choice. It requires no external 
  perl components. 

2. Configuration

  To use the script you need some other backend to keep the SOA and static
  records. Configure powerdns with these (replace with your config):

  launch=gsqlite3,pipe
  gsqlite3-database=/etc/powerdns/pdns.db
  pipebackend-abi-version=1
  pipe-command=/etc/powerdns/rev.pl

  Also, edit the script and add your dynamic domains. Please note that the  
  prefix must be divisable by 16 bits. This means, you can use the following
  lengths: 0,16,32,48,64,80,96,112 and 128. Any other prefix length will 
  be rejected.  

  Remember to add the corresponding forward and reverse domains into the
  other backend. 

3. Testing

  The script comes with a very small test suite which you can run. It will not
  work if you change the rev.pl settings. It'll check that the script produces
  known good values, and also gives estimate how fast it can perform.
